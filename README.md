# 🌀 Biggest Atlantic Hurricanes (Excel)

This project examines historical data on major Atlantic hurricanes using Microsoft Excel.  
The file contains a list of significant storms with details including hurricane name, start date, estimated economic damage (in USD millions), category, and maximum wind speed.

A supporting reference table for the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale is also included within the sheet to help interpret category values.

The purpose of this project is to organize the dataset, understand hurricane intensity levels, and present the information clearly within Excel.

## 📁 Dataset Overview

The analysis is based on a dataset containing historical records of major Atlantic hurricanes.  
After removing unused header rows and extra columns, the cleaned dataset includes the following fields:

- **Name** – The name of the hurricane  
- **Start Date** – The date when the storm began  
- **Damage (USD Millions)** – Estimated economic damage caused  
- **Category** – Hurricane category on the Saffir-Simpson scale (1–5)  
- **Max Wind Speed** – Maximum recorded wind speed during the storm  

These fields provide a clear view of each hurricane’s intensity and overall impact.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

This project focuses on organizing and understanding the information contained in the hurricane dataset.  
The main objectives are:

- Identify the strongest hurricanes based on maximum wind speed  
- Compare hurricanes by category  
- Review economic damage estimates recorded in the dataset  
- Present the data in a clear and structured format within Excel  
- Use the reference scale to interpret category levels and wind speed ranges  

These objectives help provide a clearer understanding of hurricane intensity and impact.

## 🛠️ Technical Skills Used

### 📌 Data Selection & Header Identification  
- Chose the correct header row from a file containing multiple header lines  
- Identified the main data columns used for analysis:
  - Name  
  - Start Date  
  - Damage (USD Millions)  
  - Category  
  - Max Wind Speed  


### 📌 Data Organization  
- Organized the dataset into a clean tabular structure  
- Recognized and separated a supporting reference table (Saffir–Simpson scale) from the main data  
- Ensured the main dataset is readable and structured for future analysis  


### 📌 Basic Excel Functions  
- Used the `SWITCH()` function in the reference table area to map categories to their wind speed descriptions  
- Applied simple cell referencing to relate values in the lookup section  


### 📌 Excel Formatting  
- Formatted column headers for clarity  
- Maintained a clear worksheet layout with the dataset and reference scale neatly separated  


These skills reflect the actual work performed in the file, focusing on data organization and clarity.

### 🌀 2. Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Category Scale
The workbook includes a reference table listing hurricane categories (1–5) and their corresponding wind speed ranges.  
This table helps interpret the “Category” column in the main dataset.
